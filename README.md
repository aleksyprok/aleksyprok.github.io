Research interests:
* Estimating heat loads on tokamak walls using [kernel density estimates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) and other advanced statistical techniques.
* Extrapolating the Sun's magnetic field based on [magnetograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetogram).
* Coronal [MHD waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics#Waves), where the corona refers to the outer layer of the solar atmosphere (see Figure 1).
* [Coronal seismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_seismology). This is a process where hard to measure quantities (e.g. magnetic field strength and plasma density) can be inferred from easier to measure quantities (e.g. wave period and damping time) using MHD wave theory.
* [Coronal heating problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_corona#Coronal_heating_problem). This problem relates to the question; "Why does the corona have a temperature of 10<sup>6</sup>&thinsp;K while the photosphere, which is closer to the centre of the Sun has a temperature of about 6000&thinsp;K?"
* Designing code to solve the MHD equations using [finite difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference), [finite volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_volume_method), [spectral method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_method) and [method of lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_lines) techniques.
